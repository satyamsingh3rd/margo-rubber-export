/**
 * One product category by slug.
 *
 * Two things happen in the projection that would otherwise have to happen in a
 * component, and both belong here:
 *
 *  · The SPEC TABLE is flattened. Sanity cannot nest an array inside an array,
 *    so a table row is stored as an object holding `cells`. The renderer and
 *    the Zod schema both expect `string[][]`, exactly as the .mdx files
 *    provide, so `rows[].cells` unwraps it and nothing downstream ever learns
 *    the storage shape was different.
 *
 *  · The PARTS GRID is filled in from the document. The block itself holds
 *    only its heading copy; the parts, the category label and the slug are
 *    read from the enclosing document with `^`. Storing them on the block
 *    would mean the same list existed twice — and that list is also the target
 *    of the 301 redirect map, so a divergence would break old inbound links
 *    without anything failing.
 *
 * `_type` and `_key` are projected through deliberately. They are what the
 * renderer dispatches on, and what React keys the list by.
