/**
 * SHARED FIELD FACTORIES
 *
 * Every block in the library is assembled from these rather than from
 * hand-written field objects. Two reasons, both about drift:
 *
 *  · 40 blocks each declaring their own "eyebrow / heading / body" trio is 120
 *    chances for the label, the description or the validation to diverge. The
 *    editor then meets the same field wearing three different names.
 *
 *  · The Zod schemas in src/content/schemas/index.ts are the build-time
 *    contract. Where a rule exists there — `min(20)` on a body, kebab-case on
 *    an anchor — it is repeated here so the editor is told in the editor,
 *    rather than a developer being told by a failed build. The numbers in this
 *    file are copied from that one deliberately; they are not new opinions.
