/**
 * SHARED FIELDS FOR THE MARKETING PAGES
 *
 * Thirteen files, twelve distinct schemas, and no leverage — that is what
 * makes this the expensive part of the migration. Products got eleven pages
 * out of one schema and SKUs thirty-one; here every page is its own shape.
 *
 * What CAN be shared is the small vocabulary they all draw on: a heading split
 * over lines, a row of buttons, a breadcrumb, a form field. Those are here, so
 * that the twelve types differ where the pages genuinely differ and are
 * identical everywhere they do not.
 *
 * All of these pages are FIXED STRUCTURE. Every route renders its sections
 * unconditionally in one order — checked, not assumed — so none of them takes
 * a block list. An editor changes the words, never the arrangement.
