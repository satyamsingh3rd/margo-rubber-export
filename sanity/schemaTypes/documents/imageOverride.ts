/**
 * REPLACING A PHOTOGRAPH
 *
 * Every image on the site currently comes from a registry in code: 85 entries,
 * each with a file, its dimensions, a blurred placeholder, alt text, and a
 * `status` marking whether it is real Margo photography or a stock stand-in.
 * Most are stand-ins.
 *
 * When the real photographs arrive, somebody at Margo has to be able to put
 * them on the site. Until now that meant a developer editing the registry and
 * deploying — which is exactly the dependency this whole project exists to
 * remove.
 *
 * THE DESIGN, and why it is an override rather than a field.
 *
 * The obvious approach — turn every image field into a Sanity image — was
 * wrong for what was actually asked. The layout is settled. The slots do not
 * move. Only the file behind each slot changes.
 *
 * So this document does not touch the content at all. Its ID IS the slot name
 * — `imageOverride-products__hero`, dots encoded — and the site checks for one before falling
 * back to the registry. Deriving the slot from the id rather than storing it
 * in a field means one slot cannot have two competing photographs, and an
 * editor cannot mistype a slot name, because neither is representable.
 *
 * Consequences worth having:
 *
 *  · The 72 migrated documents keep their image keys untouched, so an upload
 *    cannot move an image or change which section it appears in.
 *  · No content schema changes, so nothing that already works can break.
 *  · Deleting the override restores the original. Nothing is destroyed.
 *  · One screen lists every slot that is still a stand-in — a to-do list of
 *    the photography Margo still owes, rather than 85 fields scattered across
 *    seventeen page types.

     * Alt text travels WITH the photograph, and stays required.
     *
     * The registry makes alt text mandatory in the type system, which is what
     * guarantees no image ships without a description. A new photograph
     * usually needs a new description — the old one describes the stock image
     * — so this is editable, but it is not optional. That guarantee is the one
     * thing about the registry worth carrying across unchanged.

    /**
     * A DECORATIVE image must be allowed to stay decorative.
     *
     * One slot on the site — the logo mark beside the "MARGO" wordmark — has
     * deliberately empty alt text, because the words are already there in the
     * markup next to it. Describing it would make a screen reader announce
     * "Margo logo MARGO Rubber Products".
     *
     * Requiring alt text unconditionally would force whoever replaces that
     * image to break it. So the requirement is conditional, and the checkbox
     * says what it means rather than leaving an empty box looking like an
     * oversight.
