/**
 * INDUSTRY — the second page type on the page builder.
 *
 * Same two halves as the product category: a fixed hero, and a body that is a
 * block list.
 *
 * Its hero is NOT the product hero, and that is the point of keeping heroes
 * out of the block library. Here the heading is an array of lines with accent
 * indices rather than a single string with a trailing accent — a different
 * shape for a different design. A shared "hero block" would have had to serve
 * both and would have served neither well.
 */

/**
 * Industry pages get a different menu from product pages.
 *
 * The whole point of the allow-list: an editor on an industry page is offered
 * the eight blocks that belong here, not the thirty in the library. The
 * closing band and the FAQ are here; the compound selector and density scale
 * are not, because no industry page has ever had one.
