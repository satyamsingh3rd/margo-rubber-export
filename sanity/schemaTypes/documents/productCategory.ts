/**
 * PRODUCT CATEGORY — the first page type on the page builder.
 *
 * Eleven pages share it, which is why it is first: a block that works here
 * works eleven times over.
 *
 * The document is in two halves, and the split is the whole design.
 *
 *  · The HERO is fixed structure. It is not a block, cannot be reordered and
 *    cannot be removed, because every category page has exactly one and there
 *    is nowhere else it could go. Making it a block would offer the editor a
 *    choice that has only one correct answer.
 *
 *  · The BODY is a block list. Which sections a page has, and in what order,
 *    is the editor's to decide. How each one looks is not — that lives in the
 *    renderer.
 */

/**
 * The blocks a category page may contain.
 *
 * An ALLOW-LIST, not the whole library. The menu an editor opens is this list,
 * so a short relevant one is the difference between choosing and hunting. The
 * density scale and the cell comparison are here because Sponge & Foam needs
 * them; the homepage's blocks are not, and the homepage will not offer these.
