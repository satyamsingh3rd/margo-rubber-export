/**
 * RESOURCE GUIDE — the eight technical articles.
 *
 * Fixed structure like a SKU, with one difference that matters more than all
 * the rest of this migration put together: it has a BODY.
 *
 * Every other page type moved content that already existed. These eight have
 * none — each .mdx file carries a comment saying the 1,200–2,200 words of
 * material engineering have to come from Margo or a technical writer, and that
 * inventing compound behaviour is the one thing this build will not do.
 *
 * So this is the only document type where the CMS is not a nicer way to edit
 * existing words but the place the words will first be written. If a guide is
 * ever going to exist, it is because somebody at Margo could sit down in
 * Studio and write it. That is the argument for the whole project, made
 * concrete on eight pages.
