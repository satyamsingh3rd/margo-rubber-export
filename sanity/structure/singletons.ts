 * warns anybody, both documents are valid, and the site's query —
 * `*[_type == "homePage"][0]` — picks whichever the content lake returns
 * first. Which one wins is arbitrary and invisible.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical. It happened to the privacy policy: the spike that
 * proved this CMS pattern created a document with a random id, a test edit
 * replaced its opening paragraph with the word "Testing", and when the proper
 * migration later wrote to a deterministic id it created a SECOND document
 * rather than replacing the first. The site went on serving the test text, and
 * every check passed, because both documents were perfectly valid.
 *
 * So: for these types, Create and Delete are removed. The document opens from
 * its entry in the Pages menu and can be edited and published, but it cannot
 * be duplicated and it cannot be removed.
