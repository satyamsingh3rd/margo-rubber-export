/**
 * /legal/[slug] — one route, three documents, built to `Privacy Policy.pdf`.
 *
 * CONTENT STATUS. The comp supplies the design for all three pages but the
 * copy for only part of one: its frame renders Privacy Policy sections 1–3
 * and stops, while the table of contents lists twelve. Sections 4–12, and
 * both other documents, therefore ship with their headings and anchors in
 * place and their bodies empty.
 *
 * That is deliberate. A privacy policy's retention periods, transfer
 * mechanisms and user-rights procedures are statements about what Margo
 * actually does with people's data, and a terms page is a contract offered to
 * a visitor. Plausible-sounding filler here would not be placeholder copy the
 * way a marketing lede is — it would be a false representation that a reader
 * is entitled to rely on, and in several jurisdictions one that carries
 * penalties. So the structure is real and the gaps are visible and named.
 *
 * Every page ships `status: placeholder`, so all three are `noindex, nofollow`
 * until counsel supplies the text. See §A of 17_Open_Questions_For_Margo.md.
