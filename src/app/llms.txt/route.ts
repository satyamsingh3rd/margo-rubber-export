/**
 * /llms.txt
 *
 * A plain-text summary of the site for language models, which read a page's
 * text but rarely its JSON-LD and never its sitemap. It answers, in one
 * fetch, the questions an assistant is actually asked about a manufacturer:
 * what do they make, to what standard, in what quantity, and where do they
 * ship.
 *
 * TWO RULES, both the reason this can exist before Margo's content does.
 *
 *  1. Every fact here comes from the facts registry in site.ts, which holds
 *     `null` for anything Margo has not confirmed. Nothing is written into
 *     this file by hand, so it cannot drift from the site or assert a
 *     founding year and country count that are still disputed.
 *
 *  2. Pages are listed only once `published`, exactly as in sitemap.ts.
 *     Pointing a model at a page whose own metadata says `noindex` would be
 *     the same contradiction, just in a different file.
 *
 * Today that means a document with the company summary and no page list.
 * That is correct: it is true, and it grows on its own as content is signed
 * off.
