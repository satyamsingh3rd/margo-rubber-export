/**
 * /sitemap.xml
 *
 * Lists only pages whose content is marked `published`. That is the same
 * switch that controls `noindex` in buildMetadata and structured data in
 * shouldEmitSchema, so the three can never disagree: a page is either
 * indexable, in the sitemap and emitting schema, or it is none of the three.
 *
 * TODAY THIS IS EMPTY, and that is correct. All 76 content files are
 * `placeholder` pending Margo's copy. Submitting a sitemap full of pages that
 * each carry `noindex` is a contradiction Google reports as an error; an
 * empty sitemap is merely a site with nothing ready yet. Each page joins on
 * the day its content is signed off, with no code change.
 *
 * NO `lastModified`. It would have to come from `new Date()` or the
 * filesystem, and under `cacheComponents` a non-deterministic value fails the
 * prerender. A date that lies about when a page changed is also worse than no
 * date at all — Google treats a sitemap whose timestamps always say "now" as
 * untrustworthy and starts ignoring them.
