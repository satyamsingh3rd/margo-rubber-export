/**
 * TRADE LANES — the pinned scroll sequence on /export.
 *
 * The map holds still while the page scrolls past it, and each trade lane
 * draws itself from Nashik to its destination in turn, one market at a time.
 *
 * WHY THIS SECTION AND NOT ANOTHER. Export IS the business, and the arcs are
 * the proposition drawn literally. This is the one place on the site where a
 * long, attention-taking sequence is arguing for something rather than
 * decorating it — and it is the only major set-piece that needs no
 * photography, because the artwork is vector and the data is already locked.
 *
 * NO JAVASCRIPT. The whole thing runs on CSS scroll-driven animation:
 * `view-timeline` on the outer section, `position: sticky` for the pin, and
 * `animation-range` slicing the pinned scroll into one window per market. No
 * library, no scroll listener, no client boundary — this stays a Server
 * Component. See the TRADE LANE SEQUENCE block in globals.css.
 *
 * DEGRADATION IS THE DEFAULT, NOT THE FALLBACK. Every rule lives inside
 * `@supports (animation-timeline: view())`, plus a reduced-motion and a
 * min-width gate. Absent any of those the section is a plain static map with
 * every lane drawn and the markets listed beneath it — which is exactly what
 * this markup renders on its own. Nothing is hidden by default.
 *
 * NO NEW COPY. Everything here is derived from data that already exists: the
 * hub label, and each market's own chip and heading. There is no invented
 * prose to be signed off.
