/**
 * PARTS IN THIS CATEGORY
 *
 * Renders the `anchors:` list that every category content file already carries.
 * The data has been authored since the content pipeline was built (31 entries
 * across 9 categories) but was never rendered, which meant two things were
 * broken at once:
 *
 *   1. There was no way to browse the individual parts Margo actually makes.
 *   2. The 301 map in §4.0 points 29 legacy WooCommerce URLs at
 *      `page#anchor` targets that did not exist in the HTML. Notably
 *      `#scorpio-footrest-mat` and `#c-pillar-garnish`, both flagged in the
 *      plan as legacy pages with real indexed equity.
 *
 * Each part therefore renders with its `id` on a real element, so the fragment
 * resolves and an inbound redirect lands on the named part rather than the top
 * of the page.
 *
 * Each card links to its SKU page under /products/[category]/[product], built
 * to strategy D3 / Scenario 1 in §4.5: route and template now, shipped noindex
 * until real per-part spec data exists. The category page keeps the ranking
 * intent; these are structure, not competing landing pages.
