/**
 * LINE ICONS
 *
 * The UI-changes2 comps use a stroked 24px icon set throughout — process
 * stages, specify parameters, sector cards, quality badges, CTA chips. These
 * are drawn to match: 24×24 box, 1.5 stroke, round caps, `currentColor`, so
 * an icon takes the colour of whatever it sits in.
 *
 * Inline rather than a sprite or a dependency: there are two dozen, they are
 * a few hundred bytes each, and shipping an icon library to render twenty
 * static glyphs on a server-rendered page is not a trade worth making.
