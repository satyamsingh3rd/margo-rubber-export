/**
 * The ONLY way an image reaches the page.
 *
 * Takes a registry key, never a path. Width/height/alt come from the registry,
 * so CLS is structurally impossible and alt text can't be forgotten.
 *
 * TWO SOURCES, one contract.
 *
 * Most images on the site are still stock stand-ins held in the registry. When
 * a real photograph arrives, somebody at Margo uploads it against this slot in
 * the CMS, and it wins here — same key, same position, different file.
 *
 * The override supplies its own width, height, alt text and blurred
 * placeholder, so every guarantee the registry provides survives the swap.
 * Anything incomplete never reaches this component: `getImageOverrides` drops
 * it and the stock image renders instead, on the principle that a worse-looking
 * correct page beats a better-looking broken one.
 *
 * A client component because four of the components that draw images are
 * themselves client components, and the override map has to be readable
 * synchronously from all of them.
