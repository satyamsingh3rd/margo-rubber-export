/**
 * BLOCKS
 *
 * The same fifteen section shapes the .mdx files already use, re-presented as
 * an ORDERED LIST rather than fifteen named fields.
 *
 * That difference is the whole page builder. A named field can be filled in or
 * left out; its position on the page is decided by the template. A list member
 * carries its position with it, which is what lets an editor drag the compound
 * table above the specification table without a developer.
 *
 * The schemas themselves are IMPORTED, not redefined. A block is exactly its
 * section plus two pieces of bookkeeping:
 *
 *   _type — which block it is. Sanity sets this; the .mdx adapter sets it too.
 *   _key  — a stable identity for React and for Sanity's array diffing.
 *
 * Because the shapes are shared, a page served from Sanity and the same page
 * served from its .mdx file produce the identical object. There is one
 * renderer, not two, and no way for the two paths to drift apart.

 * moves that copy out of the template — where nobody could edit it — and into
 * the content, where it belongs, without changing a pixel of what renders.
