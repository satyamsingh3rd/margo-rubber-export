/**
 * PHOTOGRAPHS UPLOADED TO REPLACE STOCK IMAGES
 *
 * Fetched once per render of the site chrome and handed to every `Img` on the
 * page, rather than looked up per image.
 *
 * That shape is forced by where `Img` is used: four of the components that
 * draw images are client components, so `Img` cannot fetch anything itself.
 * The alternative — resolving overrides inside every page's data fetch — would
 * mean changing the props of every component that takes an image key, which is
 * most of them. Loading one small map at the top is the cheaper trade.
 *
 * The map is small by construction: at most one entry per registry slot, 85
 * slots, and only slots an editor has actually replaced.
