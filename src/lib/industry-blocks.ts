/**
 * .MDX FRONTMATTER → BLOCK LIST, for industry pages.
 *
 * Same job as product-blocks.ts and the same contract: THE ORDER BELOW IS THE
 * ORDER THE ROUTE RENDERED, and nine live pages depend on it.
 *
 * One difference worth noting. The industry route has no alternating band
 * counter — it hard-codes `bg-[#050505]` on specific sections rather than
 * counting. That means banding here is a property of the block type, not of
 * its position, so a reordered page keeps each section's own background. It is
 * a weaker design than the product pages' alternation, but changing it would
 * change how nine pages look, and this migration is not the place.
