/**
 * WHERE A ONE-OFF PAGE COMES FROM
 *
 * The marketing pages — home, about, the hubs, contact, the utility pages and
 * the footer — are each their own shape, and each exists exactly once. That
 * makes them the simplest seam on the site and the most tedious page type to
 * model: twelve schemas, no leverage.
 *
 * One function serves all of them, because the differences between these pages
 * live entirely in their schemas and not at all in how they are loaded. The
 * route passes the same Zod schema it always did; this tries Sanity first and
 * falls back to the .mdx file, exactly as the other four seams do.
 *
 * The projection is generic — `{..., "slug": slug.current}` — because there is
 * nothing to reshape. These pages have no block lists, no joined-in
 * collections and no arrays-inside-arrays. Whatever the document holds is what
 * the template wants.
