/**
 * SLUG → the schema that validates it and the Sanity type that stores it.
 *
 * The marketing pages have no shared schema, so this map is the only place
 * that knows which of the twelve applies to a given slug. It is imported by
 * the migration writer AND by `check:cms`, so a page cannot be migrated
 * against one schema and checked against another.
 *
 * A slug absent from here has not been migrated yet and is served from its
 * .mdx file. Adding an entry, a document type and a line in page-source.ts is
 * the whole of what migrating one of these pages involves.
