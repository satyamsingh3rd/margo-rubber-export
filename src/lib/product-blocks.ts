/**
 * .MDX FRONTMATTER → BLOCK LIST
 *
 * The adapter that lets one renderer serve both content sources.
 *
 * A category .mdx file has fifteen optional NAMED fields and no notion of
 * order; the route decided that. A CMS document has one ordered LIST and no
 * named fields. Rather than maintain two renderers, the file is converted to
 * the list on read, using the order the route used to hard-code.
 *
 * ORDER IS THE CONTRACT. The sequence below is exactly the sequence of
 * `{fm.xSection && …}` stanzas the route contained, and eleven live pages
 * depend on it — both for what a visitor reads and for the alternating page
 * bands, which are counted over whichever blocks a page actually has. Changing
 * this array changes those pages. It is the one thing in this file that is not
 * free to be tidied.
 *
 * The .mdx files are not being rewritten to hold block arrays. They keep their
 * named fields and are converted on read, so a page can move to the CMS one at
 * a time and the ones that have not moved are untouched.
